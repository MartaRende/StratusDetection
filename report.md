## Tasks

1. Data analysis
    - Analysis of days on which the stratus is present 
    - Isolation of a few days when the layer is present through median analysis (calculation of the delta between nyon or d√¥le irradiation)
2. Increased model size
3. Data preparation 
    - Data normalisation
    - Pseudo-random splitting of data, being sure to have a good percentage of days with and without layer in train and test
4. Code written and tested for training 
5. Code written and tested for inference
6. Some statistics done(mae, mse, accurancy, relative error)
